# EECE7397-Advanced-Machine-Learning
Code written as part of the Advanced Machine Learning class.
This includes the course project in which the performacne of LDA and BERT is compared on the task of topic modelling.
**BERT vs LDA**
This project compares the performance of the large language model BERT -
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (Devlin et al.,2019) against
the performance of LDA (Blei et al.,2003) on the task of topic modeling. To do this the
20 Newsgroups dataset is used. Suitable evaluation metrics are discussed and applied.
Experiments indicate that LDA is a superior method for the task of topic modeling.
Analysis is performed to explore reasons for the disparity in performance between the
two models and possible future directions for research in this problem.
